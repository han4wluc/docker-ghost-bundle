Docker Ghost Bundle

I love nobrainer bundles. This is just a very lean nobrainer boilerplate I had to setup in order to get docker-library/Ghost running.

Just edit the start.sh and config/config.js to your taste, eventually add a theme of you choice to content/themes and you'll be good.

Start the ghost docker container just by calling ./start.sh

Enjoy! :)
